# DEVOPS
## DEVOPS PROJECTS COLLECTION
Welcome to my DevOps Project Collection 🚀 — a curated set of hands-on projects that showcase my skills 🧠, experience 💼, and problem-solving approach 🔍 in the world of DevOps ⚙️. Each folder represents a real-world scenario covering areas like CI/CD pipelines 🔄, Docker 🐳, Kubernetes ☸️, Terraform 🏗️, monitoring 📊 with Prometheus & Grafana, and cloud deployments ☁️ on AWS. These projects highlight not just the tools 🧰 I used, but also the decisions 🤔 I made and challenges 🚧 I overcame. From designing scalable architectures 🏢 to automating deployment workflows 📦, every project is backed with clear documentation 📘 and real-world context. I see DevOps as more than just tech — it's a culture of collaboration, reliability, and continuous improvement 🔁. Dive in, explore 🌍, and feel free to clone or contribute 🤝!
