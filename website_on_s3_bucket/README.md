# Host a Website on Amazon S3

## Hosting my website on Amazon S3!

This project is about hosting a website on Amazon S3. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time from anywhere on the web. In this project, I'll be creating an S3 bucket to store pictures and files needed in my very own website.
I'll be using Amazon S3 (which stands for Amazon Simple Storage Service) to host a website. I will show the steps I used to access the S3 bucket and host my website.
