# Host a Website on Amazon S3

## Hosting my website on Amazon S3!

This project is about hosting a website on Amazon S3. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time from anywhere on the web. In this project, I'll be creating an S3 bucket to store pictures and files needed in my very own website.
I'll be using Amazon S3 (which stands for Amazon Simple Storage Service) to host a website. I will show the steps I used to access the S3 bucket and host my website.

6. For Object ownership, I chose "ACL's Enabled", Enabling ACLs in this S3 setup lets you control who can access and do things with the         objects (i.e. website files) you upload into your bucket. With ACLs, different AWS accounts can own and control different files in your      bucket.
7. For Block Public Access settings for this bucket, I cleared the check box for Block all public access.

8. I endbaled bucket versioning. and created the AWS S3 Bucket.
