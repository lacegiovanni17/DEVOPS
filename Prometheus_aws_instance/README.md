## Procedure and Process

🚀Monitoring with Prometheus on AWS 🚀

Today, I turned my AWS EC2 instance into a robust monitoring hub using Prometheus—the go-to tool for tracking system metrics! Here’s how I made it happen:

🔹 Launched my EC2 Instance

Provisioned an Ubuntu 24.04 server on AWS, connected via SSH, and prepped the environment with essential updates.

🔹 Installed Prometheus

Visited prometheus.io, copied the Linux download link, and ran curl -LO <prometheus-link> on my server to grab the file. Extracted it with tar -xzf prometheus-\*.tar.gz and started the server with ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml.

🔹 Solved Security Setup

Added the :9090 rule to the instance’s security group in the AWS console, ensuring external access. Fired it up and started exploring the Prometheus dashboard! 🎯

This cloud-native setup gives me real-time insights into my system’s health—perfect for tracking performance before scaling up.

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. Developed by SoundCloud and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), it collects metrics from various targets using a pull-based model.

Key Features of Prometheus:

Time Series Data: Stores metrics with timestamps for analysis.

Powerful Querying: Uses PromQL for flexible data retrieval.

Alerting: Notifies on anomalies via integrated rules.

Service Discovery: Automatically finds targets in dynamic environments.

Multi-Cloud Support: Works on AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-premises.

Prometheus = The heartbeat monitor for your infrastructure.

In my simple understanding, Prometheus is like the nurse that periodically checks the heartbeat and vitals of a patient, while Grafana is a visualization tool similar to the ECG equipment that shows the heartbeat in a sinewave diagram. By using Prometheus, I get a real monitoring experience without complex setups—ideal for devops engineers and developers!
